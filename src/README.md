# ZkSync support to Viem

This is a repo where most of the work will be done. Seperate PR's will be created to be merged with the official repo.

Note that to be able to run tests you need to define `VITE_ANVIL_PORT` to other than `8545`, the default one used by (local setup)[https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/dockerized-testing.html]
